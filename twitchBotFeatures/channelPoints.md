# TASagent Twitchbot Channel Points

TASagentPuppet can interface with channel points in a few ways.  Such features require the bot be responsible for creating the channel point reward using the API.

## Scams

TASagentPuppet can scam users out of their channel points.  It tracks and accumulates points spent superfluously in this way.

Cumulative scammed point totals and a scam leaderboard can be viewed with the `!leaderboard` command.

Scammed point totals can be queried for yourself with the `!points` command and for others with the `!points <username>` command.
